# lotr-js-game
A little JavaScript text game based on the Lord of the Rings that I created for my son and daughter.

I was going through a JavaScript tutorial on Codecademy and decided to make something that my kids would enjoy. 

I would like to make the game more complex at some point. For now enjoy the 15 seconds of LOTR fun!

Play the game using JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/JesseRWeigel/r24r73f6/
