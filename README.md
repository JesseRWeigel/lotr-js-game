# lotr-js-game
A little JavaScript text game based on the Lord of the Rings that I created for my son and daughter.

I was going through a JavaScript tutorial on Codecademy and decided to make something that my kids would enjoy and that we could create together. They are helping me to come up with new ideas for enemies, and I write the code. It's a fun way to introduce them to coding.

I would like to make the game more complex at some point. For now enjoy the LOTR fun!
